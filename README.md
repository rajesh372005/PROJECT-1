Simple Explanation of the Online Quiz Platform

This Online Quiz Platform is a simple web application used to conduct quizzes on a website.

The quiz page is created using HTML to display the questions and options. CSS is used to design the page and to highlight the option when the user clicks on it. JavaScript is used to control the quiz logic, such as moving to the next question, checking the selected answer, and calculating the score.

The quiz contains 10 multiple-choice questions. For each question, the user can select only one option. When an option is clicked, it gets highlighted so the user knows which answer is selected.

After selecting an option, the user clicks the Next button to move to the next question. If no option is selected, the system shows an alert message.

At the end of the quiz, the system displays the final score showing how many questions the user answered correctly out of 10.

This project helps in understanding basic web development concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction using JavaScript.
